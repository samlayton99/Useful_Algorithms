## Contents:

- **Binary Trees**: 
    - This module delves into the mathematical underpinnings of binary trees, from basic trees and recursion to advanced structures like BST and AVL trees. 
    - Through performance metrics and real-world datasets, the project illuminates the efficiency advantages of tree-based structures over linear ones such as linked lists.

- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: 
    - Focused on the actor-movie network, BFS is employed to depict the "small-world phenomenon" within Hollywood, emphasizing minimal collaborations linking actors. 
    - Utilizing the NetworkX library, the project offers insights that can aid casting decisions, movie recommendations, and broad applications in network routing and pathfinding.

- **Image Segmentation**: 
    - Centered around graph theory, this module translates images into graph structures, leveraging matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors to segment them based on pixel brightness. 
    - With applications ranging from medical imaging to computer vision, the project refines recognition and analysis capabilities by segmenting data for machine learning models.

- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization**: 
    - This module dissects the theory and practice of NMF, decomposing a non-negative matrix into two distinct matrices. 
    - Beyond the theoretical framework, practical applications include image processing, vectorizing images, and assessing their decomposition and reconstruction performance.

- **PageRank**: 
    - Rooted in linear algebra, the PageRank algorithm evaluates node significance in directed graphs, leveraging adjacency matrices for representation. 
    - The module's extensive applications range from ranking web pages and NCAA teams to assessing actor prominence based on film collaborations.

- **SVD Image Compression**: 
    - Focusing on Singular Value Decomposition, this project applies the matrix factorization technique to image compression. 
    - Essential functions facilitate matrix decomposition, visualization, and approximation, ultimately showcasing the capability to compress both grayscale and RGB images with tools like numpy and scipy.
